## Legacy
This was a project that my flatmate and I decided to start - we didn't really get anywhere far with it however, I would say that this was the most important project out of them all. When starting University I didn't know how to code at all, so when starting this project only a 2-3 months into my course was a challenge.

The idea was to allow businesses to search for new potential employees from a rich pool of data that involved things such as task completion and general time tracking. This enabled factors such as motivation and skill to be examined at fine detail thus increasing chances of finding successful applicants and reducing the cost of reqruitment.

This project involved both a website and a mobile application - the website was pretty easy to set up as it didn't need to have many custom features so we decided to save a lot of time and just use Wix to create it. However, the mobile application needed a little more care, we got some advice from another experienced developer (my brother) to look into React Native to begin our journey with the app - and so we did. This was the start of my React journey...

Few months went by and we had a very basic login screen with an even more basic homepage - however, this was big as both him and I did not know any React Native nor Javascript. We decided to stop working on the project not long before exams started as we both knew we needed to put our focus elsewhere.

**Learning**: We rushed into product development rather quickly without exploring all options. For this reason we got overwhelmed when needing to change a certain feature as the requirements have changed through research. This eventually made us step backwards many times during the process and got very little done, instead we were stuck in conversations as we had no idea what to do.

This was the first paid project that I had landed, purely by mistake involving a tipsy conversation in a bar. This was a simple application aimed to be released for iPads - the idea was for the user to be able to take a photo of themselves (like a photo-booth) and then have the option to send it to themselves by email. I liked the idea, and it was an opportunity to earn some extra money in my first year of university - perfect.

The client was aware that I have not done anything like this before and that I would be learning through the entire process - which they were fine with as I had lowered my price as a result. There were many learning curves for this project as I had to complete the application from start to finish including publishing to the app store.

Since this was my first paid project I underestimated how client work is like - making a newbie mistake of setting a fixed price at the start and agreeing to do everything in between (too keen). The project requirement ended up being extended to having an admin login for the application on a website - this was built in React which was also an on-the-job training. 

After eventually getting everything working I had to wait an exceptionally long time to get feedback from the client (6 months) in order to fully close the contract - this is where things started to go bad for Year 2 at university. The original plan was to start this project at the end of June after my exams and have a finished product start of August where I then took 1 month off for a holiday and general relaxation as I had another freelance project planned to start 1st September. Having finished a week early I was happy about this as it meant that I had extra time, however, the project ended up finishing towards the end of February the year after due the lack of response.

Nethertheless, I have learnt a lot from this project in terms of programming and how business works - despite the codebase being so bad that even now I refuse to look at it, but I had to learn somehow.

P.S. I didn't want to harm the company's image as since sharing my experience with them they have changed how they operate and are significantly better. However, I wanted to stay true to my thoughts hence I made the decision to keep their name a secret.

**Learning:** I assumed that everything will run smoothly, things will be on time and that's it. This wasn't the case and I find this is never the case, I should've took this into account in terms of timing and the amount I charged for the project - when I roughly worked out how much I made per hour it was something close to Â£1.50...

This was a very fun project to do with nightlife - it allowed people to store points at each valid club or bar and then claim them for drinks. These conversations held place during the end of my first year at university so this sounded great to me. I loved working with the founders for this project as they were very understanding letting me start in September even though we signed everything in June.

These guys were ready for development in every way, they had wireframes, designs, documents, motivation and funding to support the project. Anything I needed throughout the project was done usually by the next day.

Unfortunately, because of the previous project over running I wasn't able to give my full attention come September and worked on it as much as I could. However, this made a massive negative impact on my course, I was getting constant low 50/60% in my coursework which is not very high considering I usually try to get high coursework to make exams easier. I realised this during the Christmas period and had to cut my hours for the project.

This was a very good experience for me as I had a major step up in my programming knowledge given that I knew a lot more. I was coming to an end of my experience with the previous projects and tried to eradicate all the bad habits from this new project. I was really happy with how things were going and even did an 18 hour straight refactor to improve the efficiency of the app (which I did by 50% in speed, and more than 80% in the amount of database queries that were made).

I couldn't finish the project on time before exams so I had to leave the project as it was - the founders eventually ended up handing the project over to another development company. I felt really bad that I couldn't give my full attention to this project, I offered to ignore my last payment that was scheduled but they were so generous and understanding that they didn't see this as an option and continued to pay.

**Learning:** This experience really made me think about time my management in terms of how poor it was. It also made me realise that I shouldn't take on so many things all at once as I will end up at not excelling at any of them, instead I will attempt to do all poorly.
